The installation of the JAR (like pixelzilla.jar) file is easy. Just go
to texturizer:

  http://texturizer.net/firebird/themes/#install

and insert the path to the jar file in the "Local File" input box (okey..
  using the browse button is much easier). You should be able to install
the JAR file.

Please keep in mind, that the pixelzilla theme won't work with *MOZILLA*.
It works only for *Mozilla FIREBIRD*. I try to make a port to Mozilla if
i've much more spare time.

For problems, suggestions and feedback about the theme drop me an email at:

  roman@bromeco.de.

Thanks for using my theme!
